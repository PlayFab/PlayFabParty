The Party Sample Network folder contains the core functionality to interact with the PlayFab and Party libraries.

To initialize the Library, call:
    Managers::Initialize<T>();
	
Where T is a class that implements the INetworkStateChangeManager interface.

Note that the core classes need to have update called every frame:
    Managers::Get<NetworkManager>()->DoWork();
    Managers::Get<PlayFabManager>()->Tick();

The relevant APIs are accessed through the managers class.

Examples:
    Managers::Get<PlayFabManager>()->SignIn(...)
    Managers::Get<PlayFabManager>()->GetDescriptor(...)
    Managers::Get<NetworkManager>()->Initialize();
    Managers::Get<NetworkManager>()->CreateAndConnectToNetwork(...)
