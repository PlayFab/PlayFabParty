# Instructions to capture trace logs for Azure PlayFab Party SDK

Please follow the instructions below to capture trace logs generated by PlayFab Party SDK integrated in your app. Once logs are collected, zip up the ETL file(s) (they compress very well) and send to us via customer support channel along with a description of the problem.

## PC (Win32 or GDK):
- From an administrator command prompt, run the `Trace-PlayFabParty.ps1` script. Pass in a label (without spaces in it) to describe the trace attempt, for example "try1", e.g.:
```
powershell .\Trace-PlayFabParty.ps1 try1
```
- Run your game and get into the state to reproduce the issue
- Hit enter in the command prompt to stop the trace. It will tell you the name of the .ETL file output

## Xbox (GDK):
> [!NOTE]
> Replace "&lt;xboxip&gt;" with your Xbox console's IP address in the commands below:
- Open up a GDK developer prompt on your PC
- For each console involved in the issue, run the following command to start log collection:
```
xbtrace /x:<xboxip> start advancedmp
```
- Run your repro scenario which demonstrates the issue in PlayFab Party
- For each console involved in the repro, run this command to finish log collection
```
xbtrace /x:<xboxip> stop
```

## Xbox (XDK):
> [!NOTE]
> Replace "&lt;xboxip&gt;" with your Xbox console's IP address in the commands below:
- Open up an XDK or GDK developer prompt on your PC
- Run these commands to start log collection:
```
xbrun /x:<xboxip>/title /o "tracelog -start bltrace -f d:\bltrace.etl"
xbrun /x:<xboxip>/title /o "tracelog -enable bltrace -guid #4E8F98A2-3DC0-4DD8-BB6F-7335068650A5 -flags 0xfffffff -level 5"
```
- Run your repro scenario which demonstrates the issue in PlayFab Party
- Run these commands to finish log collection:
```
xbrun /x:<xboxip>/title /o "tracelog -stop bltrace"
```
- Then copy the trace back:
```
xbcp /x:<xboxip>/title xd:\bltrace.etl
```
